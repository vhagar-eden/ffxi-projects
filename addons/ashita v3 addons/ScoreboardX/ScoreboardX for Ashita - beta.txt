**Scoreboard --> ScoreboardX for Ashita v3**

Core Functionality -

✅ Fixed DPS clock behavior → now starts on first actual damage dealt by party/alliance, and pauses if no damage is dealt for 5+ seconds.
✅ Added robust pet-owner mapping so pet damage always credits to the owner, even if the owner hasn’t dealt direct damage yet.
✅ Implemented ID-based solution for skillchains so SC damage is attributed to the closing player, not left as its own entry.
✅ Unified damage merging system → totals now always combine (Player + Pet + SC).

Display & Reporting -

✅ Reformatted damage report from one-line with commas → multi-line output, one player per line.
✅ Added damage breakdown in reports → (P:XX + Pet:XX + SC:XX) with percentage totals.
✅ Fixed display so pets and SC entities no longer appear as separate names (e.g., Skillchain(Vha.) or pet abbreviations).
✅ Updated report_stat output → each entry prints on its own line instead of one wrapped string.

Quality of Life & Usability -

✅ Changed report title/header → "Total Damage Breakdown -" instead of "Dmg:".
✅ Cleaned up percentage formatting → removed redundant parentheses around %.
✅ Ensured reportstats still works and can show pets separately when needed.
✅ Tested and confirmed merged totals still calculate correctly across display and reporting.

Addon Identity -

✅ Renamed addon to ScoreboardX to keep it separate from the original.
✅ Updated folder name, main .lua file, and command alias → new commands are /sbx.
