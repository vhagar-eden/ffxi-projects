# ScoreboardX 2.0 for Windower

## Description:
This addon is based on the original Scoreboard for Windower and Ashita. I took that addon and added my own fixes in addition to some unique features and changes, and renamed it ScoreboardX.

## Major Changes:
- Fixed DPS clock behavior - now starts on first actual damage dealt by party/alliance, and pauses if no damage dealt for 5+ seconds.
- Pet damage now counts as player damage and is added to their total.
- Skillchain damage now counts as player damage and is added to their total.
- Fixed display so pets and SC entities no longer appear as separate names (e.g., Skillchain(Vha.) or pet abbreviations).
- Added damage breakdown in reports - (P:XX + Pet:XX + SC:XX) 
- Reformatted reporting from one-line with commas to multi-line output, one player per line.
